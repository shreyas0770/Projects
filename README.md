The following are descriptions and links to my projects in the VLSI and Embedded Systems domain.

VLSI Projects:
1) RTL to PnR implementation of Synchronous FIFO module (2023) 4
- Designed a Synchronous FIFO module using Verilog HDL on Cadence tool Xcelium and synthesized the design
using Cadence Genus tool on 45nm technology.
- Utilized Cadence Innovus for the physical design stage, followed by analysis of timing, area, and power reports across
both design and physical phases.

2)FPGA Controlled Line Follower Robot
 - Designed and implemented a line follower robot using Altera Cyclone IV FPGA board
 - Developed the control logic in Verilog HDL using 
   Intel Quartus Prime and interfaced it with the motors and sensors of the robot.

Embedded Systems Projects:

1)Forklift Automation for Efficient Object Handling and Transport
- An automated forklift system that uses OpenCV to read barcodes and determine package size and weight, and assigns
the required number of forklifts to transport it.
- The system utilizes a line follower algorithm for autonomous navigation and a forklift with a lead screw mechanism for
autonomous lifting and dropping of objects.

2)Sustainable Footstep Energy Generator
- An Arduino based sustainable energy generation system that converts footsteps into electrical energy using
Piezoelectric Sensors and stores it in a lithium-ion battery.
- The system provides a reliable power source for charging authorized smartphones using an RFID Sensor,
demonstrating its practical application in mobile charging capabilities.
