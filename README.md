The following are the code files for 3 projects of mine:

1)AUTOMATED FORKLIFT SYSTEM FOR EFFICIENT
OBJECT TRANSPORT IN INDUSTRY
 - The system utilizes the laptop's webcam to read barcodes on
   packages to determine its size and weight, and automatically
   assigns the required number of forklifts to lift it.
 - It was successfully demonstrated in a physical environment, 
   with the forklift utilizing a line follower algorithm to navigate to 
   the pickup point, autonomously lift the object, and transport it to the designated location. 
 - The project involved integrating computer vision, a line follower algorithm,
   and a forklift with lead screw mechanism, enabling autonomous lifting and dropping of
   objects.

2)FPGA-BASED LINE FOLLOWER ROBOT
 - Designed and implemented a line follower robot using DE0- Nano FPGA board
 - Developed the control logic in Verilog HDL using 
   Intel Quartus Prime and interfaced it with the motors and sensors of the robot.


3)SELF-SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GENERATION FROM
FOOTSTEPS
 - Developed an energy generation system that converts
   footsteps into electrical energy using piezoelectric sensors
 - Used a lithium-ion battery to store the generated energy
   and provide a reliable power source for charging authorized
   smartphones using an RFID sensor. 
 - Demonstrated the practical application of the system by
   showcasing mobile charging capabilities from the stored
   energy in the lithium-ion battery.
